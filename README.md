I (NicholasHarlanHancock) will be changing the main branch. If someone else edits the code, please either start a new branch or pull request or just make a new file or folder (whatever is easiest, which is probably that last one â€” copying everything into a new folder), so we can avoid edit collisions.
#
If you need code explained, put a question comment next to it, and I'll eventually notice.
I will do the same if I'm confused by code anyone else adds.

Tips:
To import .py files, you must leave off the ".py" extension. Also, the .py files should be in the same directory to make sure this works.
