# Incoming distribution:
# Initial position range comes from 3mm radius source,
# Very soon it hits a tungsten moderator.
# It doesn't matter how soon, the disk of possible impact locations should be 3mm + maxA/omega in radius.
# maxA here is the radius of the cyclotron beam, which actually max_v_0 = sqrt(2*maxKE/mass)
# Na-22 Î² decays with:
# 545.5 keV (89.8% abundance/maximum energy)
# 215.5 keV (89.8% abundance/average energy)
# 2842.1 keV ( 0.6% abundance/maximum energy)
# 834.8 keV ( 0.6% abundance/average energy)

# I don't understand the parentheticals.

# The isotope Na-22 decays  (in 99.95% of cases) with half-life of 2.6 years for positron emission or electron capture
# to the first excited state of 22-Ne at 1.274 MeV (which subsequently relaxes with gamma photon emission).
# The positron is emitted with maximum energy of 544KeV
